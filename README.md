RAIDA GO Console program allows you to verify that you have received funds in your Skwyallet and to send funds to another Skywallet account from your Skywallet.

## Installing raida_go

The Linux version can be found at https://CloudCoinConsotium.com/zip/raida_go.zip

The Linux version can be found at https://CloudCoinConsotium.com/zip/windows_raida_go.zip

Once you unzip the folder, we suggest you unzip it in your /usr/local folder. Your folder structure will end up looking like the tree below. The raida_go folder will contain 
the config.toml file, the raida_go executable, and the cloudcoinlogs and ID folders. 
```
/usr/local/cloudcoin
                  │   config.toml
                  │   raida_go
                  ├───logs
                  └───debit_cards

```
Note: Before you can run the raida_go program on Linux, you must first make it an executable by running: 
```bash
chmod +x raida_go
```
Also Note: This program will write a log file to a folder that you specify. You must give the program permissions to write to that folder. We recommend that you create a folder called "cloudcoinlogs" and give your web server write permissions to that folder. 
```bash
chmod 100 /usr/local/cloudcoin/logs
```

./raida_go -help balance
```

## Config
You can configure the behaviour of the RaidaGo by using a configuration file. The file must be placed in your raida_go folder. This folder is located in the user's directory.

For Linux:
/home/user/raida_go/config.toml

For Windows:
c:\Users\User\raida_go\config.toml

The file is in TOML format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML):
Only three directives are supported at the moment

```toml
title = "RaidaGo Configuration File"
  
[main]
# connection and read timeout
timeout = 40

# main domain name
main_domain = "cloudcoin.global"

# max number of notes that can be trasferred at a time
max_fixtransfer_notes = 400

```

## View Receipt
View receipt allows you to see the money that someone sent to your Skywallet. You must provide 
your account name and the GUID the customer has sent you in their memo. Note, the Skywallet point of service (POSJS) software will generate a guid for the customer and they will never see it.  

```console
$ ./raida_go view_receipt 080A4CE89126F4F1B93E4745F89F6713 merchant.mydomain.com
{"amount_verified":100,"status":"success","message":"CloudCoins verified"}
```
Same Example in Windows:
```console
C:\xampp\htdocs\cloudcoin\raida_go.exe view_receipt 080A4CE89126F4F1B93E4745F89F6713 merchant.mydomain.com
{"amount_verified":100,"status":"success","message":"CloudCoins verified"}
```
To see additional Debug Info:

```console
$ ./raida_go -debug view_receipt 080A4CE89126F4F1B93E4745F89F6713 merchant.mydomain.com
```

```

## Deposit
Deposit allows you to take CloudCoins that are located on your hard drive and upload them to your Skywallet. 

The Deposit command has not been implemented in raida_go but we could easily do this if needed. If you need the Deposit function email CloudCoin@Protonmail.com.

## Withdraw

Receive allows you to take CloudCoins out of your Skywallet and download them to your hard drive. 

The Withdraw command has not been implemented in raida_go but we could easily do this if needed. If you need the Withdraw function email CloudCoin@Protonmail.com.

## Balance
Balance allows you to see the total amount of CloudCoins in your Skywallet. It can also be used to see the balance in another skywallet if they give you the AN of one of their ID Coins.

Sample call of the ID coin in your ID folder:
```bash
Linux: 
$ ./raida_go balance

Windows: 
raida_go.exe balance
```
Sample call of another person's account using their "view balance" key:
```bash
Linux: 
./raida_go balance sean.CloudCoin.global 1.15.ddf82992e895449da47d2ddf52d7dc5f 1.24.9843782885464e48aed29542710ef98c
```
where "sean.cloudcoin.global" is the user's account, The '1' is the network number, the '15 and '24' are the RAIDA Numbers and the GUIDs are ANs also know as the Access Key  and backup Access Key. These keys can be given to others to check the balance.

```console
$ ./raida_go balance
{"total":2798}
```
Same Example in Windows:
```console
# C:\xampp\htdocs\cloudcoin\raida_go.exe balance
{"total":2798}
```
